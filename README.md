Mobile App Development - Login App
Overview
This repository contains the source code for my Login App, which I developed as part of the CS 360 Mobile Architect & Programming course. In this project, I created a functional mobile app with a simple login system that allows users to input their username and password, and after validation, they are redirected to a dashboard screen. This project demonstrates my ability to apply mobile app development best practices and user-centered design principles.

Project Details
I designed and developed this app using Android Studio, focusing on creating an easy-to-use and intuitive interface. Key features include:

Login system: Users can enter their credentials (username and password) for authentication.
Dashboard navigation: After a successful login, the user is taken to the dashboard.
User-centered design: I focused on keeping the UI simple and easy to navigate, making sure it’s accessible to a wide range of users.
This project serves as an artifact in my Computer Science portfolio, showcasing my mobile app development skills.

App Features
Login System: The app uses hardcoded credentials to validate users. If the credentials are correct, the user is taken to the dashboard screen.
Clean UI: I designed the user interface to be straightforward and easy to use, ensuring users have a smooth experience.
Modular Design: The app is developed using a modular approach, which makes the code easier to maintain and extend in the future.
Reflection
1. What did I learn while completing this artifact?
Throughout this project, I learned how to build a fully functional mobile app from scratch. I improved my skills in Android Studio, particularly in managing user inputs, validating credentials, and navigating between different screens. I also deepened my understanding of how to design a user interface that’s both functional and intuitive.

2. What challenges did I face when completing this artifact?
One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that the login system worked smoothly while keeping the user experience simple. I had to carefully design the interface to make it user-friendly while also ensuring the validation process was secure and seamless. Testing the app on different devices and screen sizes was another challenge, as I had to ensure it looked and worked well across all platforms.

3. How does this artifact demonstrate that I have met the outcomes of the course?
This project demonstrates that I’ve successfully applied mobile app development best practices and user-centered design principles. It shows that I can develop functional, well-structured, and maintainable code while also focusing on creating a positive user experience. The clean design of the app highlights my ability to balance functionality with ease of use.

4. How will this artifact help me achieve my future goals?
This project is an important part of my portfolio and will be useful when presenting my skills to potential employers. It demonstrates my ability to create mobile apps from concept to completion, focusing on both the technical and design aspects. In future job interviews, I can reference this project to showcase my abilities in app design, development, and problem-solving.
